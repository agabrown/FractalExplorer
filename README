FractalExplorer
---------------

A fractal viewer implemented in Java. Written mainly for my own entertainment
and inspired by the Fractile Plus app (http://fractile.net, with no pretence of
getting even close to the performance and smooth feel of Fractile Plus!).

The Java project is developed on a Linux system within Eclipse and uses Maven for
depency management and building. It depends only on the JUnit (http://junit.org)
and iText (http://itextpdf.com) libraries.

Requirements
------------

Dependencies are managed through Maven (http://maven.apache.org/)

Building the project
--------------------

Use "mvn package" from the command line.

Documentation
-------------

Javadocs can be generated with "mvn site" and then read using a browser (find the "site" folder in "target").

Running FractalExplorer
-----------------------

One can run the explorer as follows:

- Java: "java -jar target/FractalExplorer-x.y.z-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar"
- Bash: using the example bash script in the "scripts" folder.
- ... (your favoured method here)

Limitations (or features, depending on your point of view) of FractalExplorer
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fractal sets are calculated and coloured at the pixel level, the "resolution"
and "smoothness" are thus determined by the screen properties. The size of the
image is hard-coded for now.

The colour coding is done at the pixel level without using sophisticated
algorithms. Together with the escape time algorithm employed this leads to
"bands" of colour. I actually like this but if you want to get rid of this see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set for suggestions.

For the moment the interface consists of a mixture of mouse-clicks and
key-strokes. Stone age, I know! But that's how I like my interfaces.

To do
-----

- Make the fractal set calculations multi-threaded.

- Showing the colour LUTs available and allowing the user to pick the one to use.

- Try out as Android app.
