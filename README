FractalExplorer
---------------

A fractal viewer implemented in Java. Written mainly for my own entertainment
and inspired by the Fractile Plus app (http://fractile.net, with no pretence of
getting even close to the performance and smooth feel of Fractile Plus!).

The Java project is developed on a Linux system within Eclipse and uses ant for
building. It depends only on the JUnit (http://junit.org) and iText
(http://itextpdf.com) libraries.

Requirements
------------

Make sure the following are in the "lib" folder:

junit-4.11.jar
hamcrest-core-1.3.jar
itext-xtra-5.4.0.jar
itextpdf-5.4.0.jar

Precise version of iText (or JUnit) is not so important, but don't forget to
adjust the build.xml file if you use a different version.

Building the project
--------------------

Use "ant dist" from the command line.

Documentation
-------------

Javadocs can be generated with "ant docapi" and then read using a browser.

Running FractalExplorer
-----------------------

One can run the explorer as follows:

- ant: "ant run"
- Java: "java -jar dist/FractalExplorer.jar"
- Bash: using the example bash script in the "scripts" folder.
- ... (your favoured method here)

Limitations (or features, depending on your point of view) of FractalExplorer
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fractal sets are calculated and coloured at the pixel level, the "resolution"
and "smoothness" are thus determined by the screen properties. The size of the
image is hard-coded for now.

The colour coding is done at the pixel level without using sophisticated
algorithms. Together with the escape time algorithm employed this leads to
"bands" of colour. I actually like this but if you want to get rid of this see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set for suggestions.

For the moment the interface consists of a mixture of mouse-clicks and
key-strokes. Stone age, I know! But that's how I like my interfaces.

To do
-----

- Make the fractal set calculations multi-threaded.

- Showing the colour LUTs available and allowing the user to pick the one to use.

- Try out as Android app.
